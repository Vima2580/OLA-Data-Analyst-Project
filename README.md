Ola Ride Data Analysis Project

In this project, I worked as a data analyst to study Ola ride patterns for one month in Bengaluru.
I used SQL to answer real business questions like ride trends, cancellation analysis, rating behavior, and revenue breakdown.
Later, I converted those insights into an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
The final output includes both the dashboard visuals and a complete PDF report explaining the analysis in detail.

Tools Used
SQL, Power BI, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Analytical Thinking.
